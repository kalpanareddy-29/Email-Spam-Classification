# Email-Spam-Classification
Checking whether the mail is spam or not 
Email Spam Classification:
This project demonstrates the classification of emails into spam and non-spam categories using a machine learning approach. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict whether an email is spam based on its content.

Project Overview:
Spam emails are a common issue in digital communication, and distinguishing them from legitimate emails is crucial for maintaining security and productivity. This project uses a Naive Bayes classifier, which is well-suited for text classification tasks, to classify emails as spam or not.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is a collection of emails labeled as "spam" or "ham" (not spam). It contains various features extracted from the emails, including text content. The dataset was preprocessed and split into training and testing sets to build and evaluate the model.
